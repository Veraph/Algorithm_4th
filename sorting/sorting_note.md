# Sorting Notes
## Elementary Sorts
### Selection Sort
For a array of N elements, loop the array N times to find the smallest one to swap with the left(N-n) one  
Time complexity O(n^2)

    array = [7, 3, 2, 5, 6, 8, 0, 1]

    len_array = len(array)
    for i in range(len_array):
        start_index = i
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i, len_array):
            if array[min_index] > array[j]:
                min_index = j

        temp = array[start_index]
        array[start_index] = array[min_index]
        array[min_index] = temp

### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is useful when sorting the partially sorted array(number of inversions is low).
Time complexity O(n^2)

    for i in range(1, len_array):
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            if array[j] < array[j-1]:
                temp = array[j-1]
                array[j-1] = array[j]
                array[j] = temp

### Shell Sort
Based on insertion sort, but allow the exchanges of array entries that are far apart.  
Normally use the increment sequence of 3n+1 (1, 4, 13, 40...), useful for large array
Approximately Time complexity O(n^2) but faster than previous two

    h = 1
    while h < len_array / 3:
        h = 3*h + 1
    while h >= 1:
        for i in range(h, len_array):
            for j in range(i, h, -h):
                if array[j] < array[j-h]:
                    temp = array[j-h]
                    array[j-h] = array[j]
                    array[j] = temp

## Merge Sort
Time Complexity O(nlogn)
Use extra space proportional to N
It is a prototype of Divide and Conquer algorithm
### Top-down Merge

    # recursively done this job
    def merge(array, lo, mid, hi):
        aux = array[:hi+1] # be careful that the slice copy do not copy the index to the right of :
        l = lo, m = mid + 1
        for i in range(lo, hi+1):
            if l > mid:
                array[i] = aux[m]
                m += 1
            elif m > hi:
                array[i] = aux[l]
                l += 1
            elif aux[l] > aux[m]:
                array[i] = aux[m]
                m += 1
            else:
                array[i] = aux[l]
                l += 1

    def merge_sort(array, lo, hi):
        mid = int(lo + (hi - lo) / 2)
        if hi <= lo:
            return
        sort(array, lo, mid)
        sort(array, mid+1, hi)
        merge(array, lo, mid, hi)
    
    merge_sort(array, 0, len(array)-1)

### Bottom-up Merge

    # instead of solve a big problem by dividing it into pieces, BU_merge do all the merges of tiny subarrays on one pass then do a second pass...
    def BU_merge_sort(array):
        for sz in range(1, len(array), sz):
            for lo in range(0, N-sz, sz+sz):
                merge(array, lo, lo+sz-1, min(lo+sz+sz-1, N-1))

## Quick Sort
Time complexity average: O(nlogn)
Space: in-space
Divide-and-conquer method  
Do much less data movement than merge sort

    # out-space quick sort
    import random
    array = [4, 5, 2, 4, 9, 1, 3, 8]
        
    def quick_sort(array):
        random.shuffle(array)
        pivot = array[0]
        less = [i for i in array[1:] if i <= pivot]
        more = [i for i in array[1:] if i > pivot]
        return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(more)

    # This method is problematic becasue it use lots of addition space, we could do the quick sort in space.

When there are lots of duplicative keys in the array, consider using the 3-way quick sort.

    def 3_quick_sort(array, lo, hi):
        if hi <= lo:
            return 
        lt = lo
        i = lo+1
        gt = hi
        v = a[lo]
        while i <= gt:
            cmp = array[i] - v
            if cmp < 0:
                exch(i, lt)
                i += 1
                lt += 1
            elif cpm > 0:
                exch(i, gt)
                gt -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
        3_quick_sort(array, lo, lt-1)
        3_quick_sort9array, gt+1, hi)

## Priority Queues
1. Support two operations: remove the maximum and insert  
2. Representations:  

Data Structure | Insert | Remove Maximum
--- | --- | ---
array(unordered) | 1 | N
array(ordered) | N | 1
linked-list | 1 | N
heap | logN | logN

3. Binary Heap(be viewed as complete binary tree)
   1. Priority tree is maintained in a heap-ordered complete binary tree in the array pq[] with pq[0] unused, hence the N keys are pq[1] through pq[N]
   2. Heap-ordered: binary tree is heap-ordered if the key in each parent node is larger than or equal to it's two children
   3. We can also build multiway heaps, if take three, then the children of K will be 3k-1, 3k and 3k+1, and k's father will be (k+1)/3. D-way heaps will reduce the height of tree from lgN to log_mN, but the cost of finding the largest chidren will be higher, this the tradeoff.

### Heap sort
Construct a heap from a given array first and do the sort

    def heap_sort(array):
        '''Construct a heap and do the sort'''
        for k in range(len_array/2, 0, -1):
            sink(array, k, len_array)
        while len_array > 1
            exch(array, 1, len_array)
            len_array -= 1
            sink(array, 1, len_array)

The second sort phrace is more like a selection sort, but because heap structure can find the biggest one faster than selection sort, hence the speed is fast.  
it is the only method that the the use of time and space is optimal.  
It is popular when space is tight(embedded system)  
Rarely used in typical applications on modern systems because array entries rarely compareed with nearby array entries, so the number of cache misses is far higher than for quick sort(even shellsort.)


## Applications
### Sorting various types of data
Define a compareTo() function(return true or false follow our well) makes it possible

### Stability
Sorting is stable if it preservers the relative order of equal keys in array (data with same key, but they come in different order or time)  

Stable Sort | Unstable Sort
--- | --- 
InsertionSort, MergeSort | SelectionSort, ShellSort, QuickSort, HeapSort

### Conclusion
Algorithm | Stable? | In place?(do not need auxiliary data structure) | running time | extra space
---|---|---|---
Selection Sort | no | yes | N^2 | 1
Insertion Sort | yes | yes | N~N^2 | 1
Shell Sort | no | yes | NlogN | 1
Quick Sort(Genearl Fastest) | no | yes | NlogN | lgN(because of recursion)
3-way Quick Sort | no | N~NlogN | N^2 | lgN
Merge Sort | yes | no | NlogN | N
Heap Sort | no | yes | NlogN | 1
