# Notes of the content

## B-trees
1. a further extension of the balanced-tree algorithm that can support %external search%.
2. for a M B-Tree, the key-pair links on a node at most M-1, at least M/2

## Network Flow
### Input
A weighted digraph, with source vertex s and target vertex t
### Mincut problem
Find a cut of minimum capacity
### Maximumflow problem
Find a flow of maximum value

## Reductions
If we can use the algorithm to efficiently solve the problem X,
whatelse problem can we efficiently solve by using this algorithm?
1. find the medium reduces to sorting
2. element distincness reduces to sorting
3. convex hull reduces to sorting

## Simulation proves that the machine are the same
